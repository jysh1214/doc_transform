# DOC TRANSFORM

It's inspired by [Four-Point-Invoice-Transform-with-OpenCV](https://github.com/KMKnation/Four-Point-Invoice-Transform-with-OpenCV). I change some code to enhance white zone and decrease noise effect.

## env
- any c++ compiler (we use clang in this project)
- opencv

## compiler & use
```
make
./transform <YOUR_IMAGE>
```

## result
<!-- <Table>
    <tr>
        <th>Input Image</th>
        <th>Output Image</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KMKnation/Four-Point-Invoice-Transform-with-OpenCV/master/Sample2/Original.png" alt="Original" width="400" height="500" align="middle"/></td></th>
        <th>Output Image</th>
    </tr>
</Table> -->
